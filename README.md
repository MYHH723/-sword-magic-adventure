# -sword-magic-adventure

A luck-based roguelike text adventure built in Python, where your character's stats decide everything and each dungeon run is uniquely generated!

🎯 Design Philosophy
This game is intentionally designed around chance and character growth, not complex player strategy. It's a lightweight, quick-play experience that emphasizes:

🎲 Luck Over Strategy – Combat outcomes depend solely on your stats vs. enemy stats

🏃 Quick Sessions – Each full run takes about 10–15 minutes

🔄 Random Generation – Rooms, monsters, traps, and merchant items are randomized every time

🎯 Simple & Clear Goal – Survive 18 rooms to escape the dungeo
